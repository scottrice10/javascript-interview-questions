/** Quick Sort
 * Runtime: O(n Log(n)) average, O(n^2) worst case. Memory O(Log(n)).
 *
 * In quick sort, we pick a random element and partition the array, such that all numbers
 * that are less than the partitioning element come before all elements that are greater
 * than it. The partitioning can be performed efficiently through a series of swaps.
 *
 * It we repeatedly partition the array (and its sub-arrays) around an element, the array will
 * eventually become sorted. However, as the partitioned element is not guaranteed to be
 * the median (or anywhere near the median), our sorting could be very slow. This is the
 * reason for the O(n^2) worst case runtime.

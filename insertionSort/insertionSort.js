/**
 * Insertion sort is a basic sorting algorithm.
 *
 * Insertion sort iterates over an array, growing a sorted array behind the current location.
 * It takes each element from the input and finds the spot, up to the current point,
 * where that element belongs. It does this until it gets to the end of the array.
 *
 * Insertion sort should be implemented as a stable sort. This means that equal elements
 * should retain their relative order. Numbers, as primitives, give us no way to check this,
 * so we'll be sorting objects with a value field, on which they will be sorted, like so:
 *
 * `[{value: 10}, {value: 5, order: 1}, {value: 5, order: 2}]`
 *
 * A stable sort must return `{value: 5, order: 1}, {value:5, order: 2}` in that order.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * EXTRA CREDIT:
 *
 * Refactor your sort to (optionally) take an explicit comparator function
 * as its second argument, so that callers can define arbitrary ways to sort elements.
 * See [Array.prototype.sort](http://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/array/sort)
 * for an example of how this works (excerpt below):
 *
 * > If `comparator(a, b)` is less than `0`, sort `a` to a lower index than `b`, i.e. `a` comes first.
 * > If `comparator(a, b)` returns `0`, leave `a` and `b` unchanged with respect to each other, but sorted with respect to all different elements.
 * > If `comparator(a, b)` is greater than `0`, sort `b` to a lower index than `a`.
 *
 * If no comparator is given, just sort the elements using `<` or `>`.
